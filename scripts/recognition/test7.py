# This is a demo of running face recognition on a Raspberry Pi.
# This program will print out the names of anyone it recognizes to the console.

# To run this, you need a Raspberry Pi 2 (or greater) with face_recognition and
# the picamera[array] module installed.
# You can follow this installation instructions to get your RPi set up:
# https://gist.github.com/ageitgey/1ac8dbe8572f3f533df6269dab35df65
